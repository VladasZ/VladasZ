## Hi there 👋, I'm Vladas. Welcome to my Github page.

I like coding for fun. 

In my spare time I work on various personal projects related to game and backend development and play drums, and Factorio.

### Some of my passion projects:

## Test engine: 

It is an attempt to create a fully functional, cross platform game engine and a full stack UI framework from scratch. 

The idea is to render all the stuff manually using low level GPU APIs and provide a high level interface to build UI and game scenes. This allow supporting of multiple platforms without relying on native UI frameworks and libraries. 

Currently supported Platforms: `macOS`, `Linux`, `Windows`, `iOS`, `Android`, and Web via `WASM`

Here is the repo: [Test Engine](https://github.com/vlasdasz/test-engine)

## My homelab:

Why use AWS? Boring. You can always buy a RaspberryPI, then stuble upon Jeff Geerling video on youtube and dive into the rabbit hole of homelabbing. It starts small, you find your old PC and install linux on it and host Valheim server there to play with your friends. Then you buy 1 mini PC, then another, then think about buying a 3D printer. The thing goes on and eventyally this is what I ended up with:

Isn't she a beauty? The rack is fully 3D printed. I checked prices of some mini racks on Amazon and decided that buyng a whole 3D printer and printing it would be cheaper. And you can design you rack exactly for your hardware. I used amazing framework for that: https://homeracker.org/ . If you are into 3D printing you should definetely check it.

It runs High Available Kubernetes cluster using [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/).
